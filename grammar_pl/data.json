After several 13-hour flights, she found it strange that on such a long journey people did not talk much to one another. Everybody watched movies, listened to music on headphones or played games on their smartphones. Liparova decided to do something about it. She boarded her next San Francisco flight with an empty notebook in her handbag, determined to ask people to write stories about themselves and share them with fellow passengers. She believed the stories could act as a natural icebreaker and would get them to talk.   \r\nYet, this wasn’t as easy as she had imagined, because at 30,000 feet she suddenly found herself suffering from stage fright. “When I think of it now, it was rather stressful, because it took me about four hours to gather the courage to walk up to the first person!” she says with a laugh. But eventually she did. She handed the notebook to a woman sitting in the first row. Inside the notebook, there was Eva’s short introduction, a story, and her question. She also gave a set of instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Read the last entry in this notebook and answer the question below it.\r\n2. Write your own story and ask a new question.\r\n3. Pass the notebook to the passenger next to you.\r\n4. Before landing, return the notebook to Eva (seat 42E).\r\n<u>Recommended:</u> sign with your seat number and leave your email.\r\n\r\nIt took hours until the last person returned the notebook to Eva. In total, 33 people answered the questions and wrote their stories. Some were more personal than others, including entries about honeymoons, babies and marriage proposals. Eva noticed that where the notebook had been passed, the passengers started talking to each other more. She was very happy about that. Her only regret is that few people left their emails in the notebook and only one of them, Flossie, answered Eva’s message. Eva hopes to find the rest of the people through social media and show them what they all created in the clouds. Eva would like to do her project again, but this time she wants to make sure that the people who decide to take part in it get the chance to read all the stories before landing.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from edition.cnn.com </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 9, "fields": {"category": 1, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "A REALLY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF ART", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto trzy zdania.

Fewer people know about the tragedies in his private life or his love of Shakespeare. This was one of the topics at the prestigious Wooden O Symposium hosted by Southern Utah University, where scholars annually present their scientific work on Shakespeare. The term Wooden O is a direct reference to Shakespeare’s theatre, The Globe, which was a round wooden structure. Most of the content presented at the conference, attracting participants not only from the US, is devoted to the playwright.\r\n\r\n<b>B.</b> One of the speakers showed that Lincoln’s lifelong admiration for Shakespeare helped him cope with the strain of the turbulent years of his presidency and gave him consolation after his son passed away. The president memorized many lines from Shakespeare’s works, was a keen theatregoer and became acquainted with actors, for example James Hackett, who appeared in a production of Henry IV. Lincoln’s letter to Hackett testifies to his love of Shakespeare. In the letter, he challenged the standing of the highly acclaimed Hamlet monologue To be or not to be, arguing it was surpassed by O, my offence is rank delivered by Claudius. Hackett was indiscreet and had the letter printed, thus exposing Lincoln to public ridicule because of his literary judgement.\r\n\r\n<b>C</b>. This story about Lincoln, alongside other titbits and serious scholarly findings, can be found in the Journal of the Wooden O, an annual publication featuring articles on Shakespeare and containing selected research papers from the symposium at Southern Utah University. Submitted articles must be peer-reviewed. Sometimes they also undergo a second review process. This approach means that the publication is a valuable source of accurate information for both scholars and non-academics who derive great pleasure from the playwright’s dramas.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from https://theamericanscholar.org; http://www.bard.org </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 16, "fields": {"category": 2, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "HUGH LANE PAINTING ROBBERY", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto cztery fragmenty.

After some time, he changed his mind and left everything to London’s prestigious Tate Gallery instead. However, shortly before he died in 1915, he made yet another will which indicated that a gallery in Dublin should own his collection. As nobody had witnessed the signing of the last will, the English court refused to recognize it as a legal document, and the paintings remained in England. 5.1. _ Yet, it was all in vain.\r\n\r\nIn 1956, two Irish citizens decided to do something about it. On April 12th, they stole an Impressionist painting, Summer’s Day, from the Hugh Lane collection in the Tate Gallery. 5.2. _ The former was a frequent visitor to the gallery, so he was a familiar figure. While he pretended to be making a copy of the painting on a sketchpad, his accomplice lifted it off the wall and put it inside a large portfolio they had brought with them. Next, they left the gallery using the front door. The whole point of the robbery was to get publicity for the cause. They even arranged for a press photographer to be on the spot and take a photo of them leaving the gallery. As a result of their ingenious scheme, the photo and the news of the robbery made the headlines the following day. 5.3. _ The entire plan proved effective. Three years later, an agreement was reached between Ireland and the UK that the collection would be shared between the two countries, and in 1999, over 30 paintings returned to Dublin for good.\r\n\r\nThe theft of the painting from the Tate Gallery was worrying for art lovers because it showed that there was a complete lack of security in a place where many masterpieces were kept. 5.4. _ Fortunately, this did not happen. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.telegraph.co.uk</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 17, "fields": {"category": 2, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "A TEMPTING OFFER", "text": "Przeczytaj dwa teksty na temat wspinania się.

He proposed that I join a guided Everest expedition scheduled to depart soon and write an article about the growing commercialization of the mountain. The magazine’s idea was that I remain in Base Camp and report the story from the glacier at the foot of the Tibetan side of the mountain. Mark insisted that I make the decision at once, so I said “yes” and went as far as to book a flight and get the required immunizations. But then, after I’d thought it through, I backed out at the last minute. Given the aversion to Everest I’d expressed over the years, one might assume that I declined to go on principle, but I did it for a different reason. As a child, I often imagined myself conquering the mountain, so the call from Outside had unexpectedly aroused a powerful, long-buried desire. I realized it would be unbearably frustrating to spend two months in the shadow of Everest without ascending higher than Base Camp. If I were going to travel to the far side of the globe and spend eight weeks away from my wife and children, I wanted an opportunity to climb the mountain.\r\nA few days later, I thought of a possible alternative. I contacted the editor and asked if he would consider postponing the assignment for a year and changing it so that I got the chance to reach the summit. The immunizations would still be valid and a twelve-month delay would give me time to train intensively to meet the physical demands of the expedition. The biggest question was if the magazine would be willing to book me with one of the more reputable guide services and cover the $65,000 fee. I’d written more than sixty pieces for Outside over the previous fifteen years, but the travel budget for these assignments had never exceeded two or three thousand dollars.\r\nBryant called back a day later. He said that the magazine didn’t usually spend such high sums on any expedition, but he thought the story about the commercialization of Everest was worth it, and if I was serious about trying to climb to the top, Outside would figure out a way to make it happen.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 18, "fields": {"category": 2, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "TREE CLIMBING", "text": "It had been nearly 40 years since I climbed a tree, and to be honest it was not something I’d expected to do again. But earlier this summer, I found myself on the Isle of Wight, putting on a safety helmet and harness and preparing to scale a 70ft oak tree, using only ropes and my own strength.\r\nFor grown-ups, tree climbing is not only a chance to relive childhood adventures while flexing some underused muscles again, it can also give your brain a big boost. Research published at the University of North Florida revealed that tree climbing can benefit our working memory. This is the part of our memory we rely on to follow instructions or directions and to remember phone numbers or items on a shopping list. The researchers discovered that when you climb a tree, your brain is constantly calculating and evaluating your spatial awareness, balance and orientation. This provides it with a vigorous workout. Quite simply, after such a challenging physical activity, your brain becomes extremely alert and ready for mental tasks. With this information firmly in mind, my wife and I, along with our sons, decided to see whether tree climbing would work that well in our case. We headed to the Isle of Wight, where Paul McCathie, an experienced tree surgeon, runs a tree climbing business. Here anyone over the age of eight can learn to climb safely.\r\nBefore we started, any fears we had about tree climbing – everything from branches giving way to suffering vertigo – were calmly talked through by Paul. He had us trained before we set off and managed to pacify all our worries. Think the rope’s going to snap, for instance? Don’t worry. Each one could bear the weight of a two-ton rhino. Paul explained we would be secured to the rope via a carabiner, a metal loop attached to a waist harness. Surprisingly, I felt totally secure in the harness. He also assured us that we could come down at any time. When our two hours were up, we were exhausted but didn’t feel like returning to ground level. When we started climbing, I had the sensation of everything spinning around, but in the end I was surprised to find the experience really calming. We all agreed it was one of the most challenging and thrilling family activities we had done together.\r\nDid it work? Did I feel more alert after my brain workout? I did my weekly supermarket shopping that evening and I didn’t forget any of the items I was supposed to buy. It’s not proof but the scientists might be right.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.express.co.uk </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 19, "fields": {"category": 2, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "GOLD HIDDEN INSIDE A PIANO", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst.

For questions 1–3, choose the answer that best matches the text and circle the appropriate letter (A, B, C or D). \r\n\r\nSUPER RECOGNIZERS\r\n\r\nOn a hot August afternoon in 2011, as rioters looted and cars burned in the streets, a group of police officers were gathered in a room in London. Projected on the wall was the blurry shape of a man with a black woolen hat pulled deep over his forehead and a red bandana covering all but his eyes. Security cameras had tracked the man setting fire to cars, stealing from shops and attacking passers-by. At that moment, Constable Gary Collins walked in. He took one look and said, “That’s Stephen Prince.” The last time he had come face to face with Stephen Prince was in 2005. It was just a fleeting encounter in court, but it was enough. Over a two-week time span prior to the meeting, Collins had identified 180 suspects out of 4000 captured by security cameras in the London riots. Meanwhile, other officers who had applied profile and facial recognition software had managed to identify just one suspect. \r\n\r\nWith its estimated one million security cameras, London is pioneering a new area of detection, one that could be cheaper than DNA analysis and fingerprinting and relies above all on human superpowers. Scotland Yard’s ever-expanding team of super recognizers is made up of men and women from across the force who score at the top end of a facial recognition test originally devised at Harvard in 2009. Constable Collins, the star of the unit, is in the rarefied top 1 percent range. The term ‘super recognizers’ was coined in 2009 by Richard Russell, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, whose work inspired the police authorities to make use of super recognizers’ skills. Russell was studying people with prosopagnosia, that is face blindness. He found that about 2 percent of people had a very poor ability to recognize faces. Then he grew curious if there were people at the other end of the spectrum, with extraordinary facial recall. Russell tested four individuals who believed they had superior face-recognition ability. The tasks included the Face Memory Test and a quiz in which participants have to identify celebrities from photographs taken mostly when they were children. All four participants scored far better than the norm. When Russell did larger-scale experiments, he concluded that 1 or 2 percent of people were super recognizers. \r\n\r\nConstable Collins, an unassuming man with cropped graying hair and a soft Cockney lilt, patrols the same streets in North London he grew up in. He has become famous among colleagues and villains alike. One of his colleagues likens his mind to a rotating file, “You show him a photo, 30 seconds later the name pops up. And he’s always on the mark.” It turns out, however, that super recognizers’ ability to remember silhouettes and faces is rarely matched by the ability to remember other details of their lives. It is unbelievable that Constable Collins, who has identified over 800 suspects, is incapable of remembering a shopping list. \r\n\r\nPossessing such a skill is not without its pitfalls. When off duty, Constable Collins tends to stare at people a bit too long. Once he was almost punched by a teenager. “Some think I’m being provocative, but I can’t help it,” he said. He deliberately moved out of London to avoid running into wanted faces from his beat. But this is not a foolproof solution. Recently, he had  to cut short an outing to the mall with his sons when he recognized a gaggle of gang members while buying sneakers. He reckons that his oldest son, 11 years old and soccer-obsessed, is also able to recognize faces. “He knows football players in countries and teams I haven’t even heard of and immediately gives the names once they appear on TV. Who knows, one day he might become a super recognizer as well.”\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from http://nymag.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 26, "fields": {"category": 5, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "MEMORY MAN", "text": "Read two texts about human memory.

A sparrow zipped across in front of him, narrowly dodged a passing car before soaring upward, catching a breeze, and drifting away. He noted the make, model, plate number, and physical descriptions of all the passengers in the car before it passed him by. Then a bus rolled to a stop nearby. He ran his gaze over it, making the same observations. A plane soared overhead, low enough for him to recognize it as a United 737, a later model because of the winglets. Sleek, silver, fast, bullet-like. Two young men walked past. Observed, recorded. Next, a woman with a dog. A German shepherd. Not that old but with bad hips. Probably dysplasia, common in the breed. Recorded. A man jabbering away on his smartphone. Dressed far too nicely. Maybe a hedge fund manager, malpractice lawyer, or real estate developer. Memory stored. On the other side of the street an old woman in a wheelchair was being rolled out of a medical transport van. Imprinted. \r\nCataloguing observations has become habitual though unintentional for him. Amos Decker noted all of this and more as his mind sorted through everything that was in front of him. Deducing here and there. Speculating sometimes. Guessing other times. He closed his eyes to block out his recent street observations, though it was all still there, like a cinema screen on the inside of his eyeballs. It would always be there. He often wanted to forget what he had just seen. But everything in his head was recorded in permanent marker. He either dialled it up when needed or it popped up of its own accord. The former was helpful, the latter infinitely frustrating. \r\nA few long months earlier, tormented by compulsive memories of his wife prematurely passing away, he had hit rock bottom. He ceased to see his clients and gave up all his cases. He lost the house to foreclosure, and “downsized” to a sleeping bag in the park. Bloated, dirty, wild-haired, bushy-bearded, he looked as if he was living in a cave somewhere, attempting to conspire with aliens. And he pretty much was, until he woke up in a Walmart parking lot one morning not long ago, staring at a Georgia-Pacific logo on the inside of his corrugated box and had the churning epiphany that Cassie would have been deeply ashamed of what he had become. So he cleaned himself up, worked a bunch of odd jobs and saved some dollars to temporarily move into a room in the suburbs. He hung out his Private Investigator shingle and took whatever cases came his way. They were mostly lowball, low pay, but they were something. His beard was still bushy, his hair still pretty wild, but his clothes were reasonably clean. Progress was always to be measured in inches, especially when you didn’t have yards or even feet of success to show off. \r\nSuddenly, a loud bang brought him back to reality. As he looked to his left, he saw it was time to get to the next stage of his surveillance. He rose and headed after the two people he’d been waiting for. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from Memory Man by David Baldacci</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 27, "fields": {"category": 5, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "COLOUR PSYCHOLOGY", "text": "Read the article.

After all, it’s the first thing we register and use to help assess the things around us, such as whether foods of a certain colour, for example blue, might be poisonous. 5.1. _ These pass into the part of the brain that rules our hormones and endocrine system, which are instrumental in regulating our moods. Unconsciously, then, our eyes and bodies constantly adapt to these stimuli, influencing our impulses and perceptions. \r\nWhile the scientific study of colour is as old as time, the study of colour’s effects on our psyche is much younger. Even two decades ago, the common perception was that, because our response to colour is subjective, it must also be unpredictable. It was the leading UK colour psychologist Angela Wright who, by studying colour harmonies and the often unconscious thought processes related to them, developed a means of predicting our reactions to colour with remarkable accuracy. 5.2. _ The key factor is that it is not one colour that triggers our responses, but a combination of shades, dyes or tinges that the human eye can distinguish. For example, a grey sky over a summer cornfield will evoke quite a different emotion than a grey winter sky downtown. \r\nTo apply colour psychology successfully, Wright also recognized the need to match the individual’s personality with the appropriate tonal colour family. There are four of these – spring, summer, autumn and winter – each reflecting nature’s patterns, and every shade falls into one of these categories. 5.3. _ Even if very different characters reside together in one house, the right colour palette can ease tensions and help create harmony. Therefore, there are no wrong colours per se, but different colour schemes do prompt different responses. 5.4. _ It was determined that a bubble-gum pink colour should be used to soothe juvenile delinquents who are behaving violently. When violent juveniles are placed in a small cell coloured in bubble gum pink, they are noted to calm down, stop yelling and usually fall asleep quickly. Colour can affect a person’s behaviour because it can change the way a person feels. It can affect mood, feelings and emotions, as studied in the field of colour psychology. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.resene.co.nz; www.reference.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 28, "fields": {"category": 5, "type": "reading", "layout": "reading-table", "title": "CAN DOGS BE A NEW TARGET AUDIENCE?", "text": "Read the text.

Deafened by a collective howl of longing? Manufacturers of dog foods will be hoping so. Last night, ITV broadcast the UK’s first advert ever targeted at dogs, featuring high-pitched sounds that are inaudible to the human ear. Dogs are notoriously immune to visuals on screen, but the advert, with noises above 17,000 Hertz, had been proven to distract dogs enough for them to leave a toy and react to the television. This, in theory, will convince gullible owners that dogs are desperate for the advertised products. \r\n\r\n<b>B.</b> Your first reaction to this – like mine – might well be to let out a melancholy howl yourself. But it is simply a natural progression, because animals are the new marketing frontier. Adults, in the age of the Internet, are now altogether too canny. And as an audience for adverts, children are strictly regulated and annoyingly prone to switches of allegiance. But dogs – can there be a better example of blind and undying loyalty? They are dream consumers. I’m only surprised that nobody thought of it before. \r\n\r\n<b>C.</b> Pet owners are, after all, completely crazy when it comes to their animals’ supposed wants. We all know of dogs that apparently “won’t eat” anything but grilled chicken. I visited a friend recently whose house rabbit had no fewer than four kinds of rabbit treats laid out in bowls in front of the fireplace. What happened to the humble carrot? Our increasing anthropomorphism means that even sensible people interpret their own animals as having distinct emotions and desires, which means we have lost all perspective. Mind you, this is written by someone who impulse-bought a device for removing “unsightly chin hair” from a horse last week. Seriously! I had the impression he was feeling bad about it. \r\n\r\n<b>D.</b> And the advertising specialists have latched onto pet adverts with the ruthlessness of a terrier with a stick of beef jerky. For years, the pet world was fairly limited in its opportunities for expenditure. You bought food and bedding and perhaps, every few years, a less tatty lead. Now, however, animals have become another outlet for our own rampant consumerism. If sales go up, I predict that within months we will have a whole slew of new animal marketing tricks. \r\n\r\n<b>E.</b> However, the Kennel Club yesterday expressed concern that some noise-sensitive dogs may be spooked. They confirm that a dog’s needs are actually pretty simple: food, warmth, love, exercise. “Dogs,” a spokesperson said, “cannot always be trusted to know what’s best for them.” As someone who once had to dissuade their dog from a wax-crayon, I can only agree. But based on my own experiment, the Kennel Club needn’t worry too much. I have now played the ad three times to Alfie (a Border Terrier) and he didn’t twitch an eyebrow. However, when I said, “Would you like a sausage? Would you?” it reduced him to hysterics. Manufacturers of dog foods, you can have that one on me. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.telegraph.co.uk</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 29, "fields": {"category": 5, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "SURFING MONSTER WAVES", "text": "Read the text.

Which car driven by James Bond would you like to  own? Now, the world’s largest collection of cars from the Bond movies (the so-called  Bondmobiles) can be yours for only £20 million. In addition to the Bond vehicles, the lucky  buyer will also get free James Bond souvenirs, including posters and photos.  The collection belongs to Michael Dezer, an American multimillionaire. His collection of over  1,500 cars is believed to be one of the largest in the world. It presents the evolution of  the automobile through American classics, European classics, military cars, electric cars and  micro-cars. Michael and his wife started building the collection years ago, and recently his son,  Gil, has joined them in this unusual hobby. The most valuable part of the collection are the 62  Bondmobiles, the cars which appeared in 25 movies about the world-famous British secret  agent James Bond.  \r\nHow did this American multimillionaire manage to get all these Bondmobiles? After all, James  Bond is a British agent, so most of the cars were in the hands of British fans. To build his  collection, Michael Dezer employed two British experts, Stuart and Barbara Donovan.  The Donovans looked out for vehicles from the films and soon discovered a Bond collection  for sale in England. They contacted their employer immediately and Dezer flew his private jet  from Florida to England to meet them. Dezer bought the collection the same day and returned  home to Miami in time for supper. The Donovans then set about the difficult task of sending so  many vehicles to America.  \r\nMichael Dezer used to keep his cars in a car park built for this purpose, but last year he moved  them to a number of museums he owns. The Bondmobiles are on display in the Miami Auto  Museum. The other cars can be seen in museums in Las Vegas and Fort Lauderdale.  In an unexpected move, this year Dezer has decided to sell his whole collection of Bondmobiles  for just £20 million, or a bit less if you’re a good negotiator. It’s a fantastic deal because  the 62 cars include the famous Ford Mustang and Aston Martin V8. The collection is for sale  on one condition. All Bondmobiles must go in one sale so the potential buyer must take them  all. The new owner can leave the cars in the museum in Miami, or can have them delivered  somewhere else – for example, back to Great Britain.  \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.yahoo.com </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 40, "fields": {"category": 3, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "AN ELEPHANT IN MY GARDEN", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto trzy zdania.

In the depths of a haunted house, something is following you. It’s getting closer, you can  sense it creeping up behind you. Luckily, you can make the ghosts recede. All you have to  do is take control of your emotions. You’re in Nevermind, an unusual video game developed  by Erin Reynolds. To complete each level, the players have to overcome their fear. If they  let stress get the better of them, the screen will get shakier and the feeling of imminent danger  will intensify. If they manage to calm down, for instance, by slowing down their breathing,  the game will ease up.  \r\n\r\nB. Reynolds started working on Nevermind when she was in an interactive media master’s  program at the University of Southern California in 2009. She was fascinated by  biofeedback, which is a process based on technology that reads the player’s heartbeat, facial  expressions or eye movement, and decided to apply it in the game she was developing for  her thesis. In order for the game to read physiological responses, the player has to wear  a heart rate sensor, which detects the fear or tension that one is feeling at any given moment.  In the case of games like this, where emotions come into play, the outcomes are less obvious  than in the case of conventional games.  \r\n\r\nC. There has been a lot of talk in the video game industry about playing games for more than  just entertainment. While most horror video games seek to provide just an exciting thrill,  Nevermind has greater ambitions. Reynolds and her team are hoping it can be developed as  a tool to teach people how to manage anxiety and improve their state of mind. The aim, says  Erin, is for players to practise being mindful of their stress level and learn how to stop their  fears from taking control in nerve-wracking situations.  \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 47, "fields": {"category": 4, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "ENSURING SAFE OPERATION OF DRONES", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto cztery zdania.

The scale of the problem is unknown. Sales of drones in Britain and many other countries are  not counted but we know the trend is increasing. America’s Federal Aviation Administration  reckons consumer sales could grow from 1.9 million in 2016 to as many as 4.3 million by 2020.  Close encounters are also on the rise and many of them can potentially be hazardous. Britain’s  Airprox Board, which is responsible for collecting reports, found 23 near-misses between  drones and aircraft between April and November last year. Today no one is sure how much  damage a drone could do to a jet airliner. 5.2. _ What’s more, many of them have metal  components, including lithium-ion batteries, which can explode if damaged.\r\nRules for operating drones are meant to ensure that collisions do not happen. 5.3. _ Not  complying with these regulations is a criminal offence. However, rules alone will not stop  accidents. Stricter control is necessary. In America, recreational users are required to register  their drones online and are given an identification number for their craft. Failure to register  could mean a fine of up to $250,000. Schemes to help identify drone operators are also planned  in Europe.\r\nTechnology can also help keep drones out of trouble. 5.4. _ Another method is a “virtual  tether”, which in effect puts a drone on an invisible leash to prevent it from flying too far from  its operator.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.economist.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 48, "fields": {"category": 4, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "THE JOB", "text": "THE JOB\r\n\r\nWar was declared at eleven-fifteen and Mary North signed up at noon. She did it hurriedly at  lunch, before telegrams came, in case her mother said no. When she reached London, she went  straight to the War Office. The ink was still fresh on the map they issued her. She rushed across  town to her post, desperate not to miss a minute of the war. Any moment now it would start –  this dreaded and wonderful thing – and it could never be won without her. The morning rush  matched her mood. In London, thousands of young women were hurrying to their new  positions, on orders from Whitehall, and Mary joined gladly the great flow of the willing.  \r\nThe War Office had given no further details, and that was a good sign. They might make her  an attaché to a general’s staff. It was even rumoured that they needed spies, which was most  appealing.  \r\nMary stopped a cab and showed her map to the driver. He held it at arm’s length and looked at  the red cross that marked where she was to report.  \r\n“This big building, in Hawley Street?”\r\n“Yes,” said Mary.\r\n“It’s Hawley Street School, isn’t it?”\r\n“I shouldn’t think so. I’m to report for war work, you see.”\r\n“Oh. Only I don’t know what else it could be around there but the school. The rest is just  houses.”\r\nMary opened her mouth to argue, then stopped. Because, of course, they didn’t have a glittering  tower labelled MINISTRY OF WILD INTRIGUE. Naturally they would have her report  somewhere insignificant. How silly of me to chatter on like this, she thought.  \r\n“Right then,” she said. “I expect I am to be made a schoolmistress.”\r\nThe man nodded. “Makes sense, doesn’t it? Half the schoolmasters in London must be joining  up for the war.”\r\n“Then, let’s hope the cane proves effective against the enemy’s tanks.”\r\nArriving at the school, Mary felt observed. She was careful to adopt the expression of  an ordinary young woman for whom the prospect of work as a schoolteacher would be thrilling.  This was her first test, after all.  \r\nShe found the headmistress’s office and introduced herself. Miss Vine nodded but wouldn’t  look up from her desk.\r\n“North,” said Mary again.\r\n“Yes, I heard you quite well. You are to take Kestrel Class. Begin with the register. Read it and  learn the students’ names.”\r\n“Very good,” said Mary.\r\n“Have you taught before?”\r\n“No,” said Mary, “but I can’t imagine there’s much to it.”\r\n“Your imagination is not on the syllabus. Be firm, organized, give no liberties, and do not  underestimate the importance of the child forming letters properly. As the hand, the mind.”  \r\nMary felt that the “headmistress” was overdoing it and decided to mention it to the woman’s  superior, once she discovered who it was. Although in mitigation, the woman’s attention to  detail was impressive. Here were pots of sharpened pencils, tins of drawing pins and a tidy  stack of hymnbooks standing neatly on her desk.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from Everyone Brave is Forgiven by Chris Cleave</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 49, "fields": {"category": 4, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "TO INTERVIEW OR NOT TO INTERVIEW?", "text": "A friend of mine once had a curious experience at a job interview. Excited about the possible  position, she arrived five minutes early and was immediately ushered into the interview room  by the receptionist. Following an amicable discussion with a panel of interviewers, she was  offered the job. Afterwards, one of the interviewers remarked how impressed she was that my  friend could be so composed after showing up 25 minutes late for the interview. As it turned  out, my friend had been told the wrong start time by half an hour. She remained composed  because she didn’t know she was late. My friend isn’t the type of person who would have  remained cool if she had known she was late, but the interviewers reached the opposite  conclusion. Of course, they could have also concluded that her calmness showed disrespect.  Either way, they would have been wrong to draw conclusions about her future performance in  her work based on her behaviour at the interview. In this case, the outcome of the interview was  beneficial for the applicant. But it doesn’t have to end that way.\r\nThis is a widespread problem. Employers like to use free-form, unstructured interviews to “get  to know” a job candidate. Such interviews are also increasingly popular with admissions  officers at universities. But, as in my friend’s case, interviewers typically form strong but  unwarranted impressions.\r\nOne way to change this is to develop an interview protocol based on a careful analysis of what  is being looked for in the candidate. Interviews should be structured so that all candidates  receive the same questions, a procedure which makes interviews more reliable and more  predictive of job success. The employer should also make sure to include a number of questions  which test job-related skills.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.nytimes.com; www.theguardian.com </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 50, "fields": {"category": 4, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "YOU CAN’T REALLY CRY IN SPACE", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst.

Vancouver, Canada\r\nRegularly performing well in worldwide “livable city” rankings, Vancouver has a new ambitious goal of becoming “the greenest city in the world” by 2020. Now, the city leads the world in hydroelectric power and regularly uses wind, solar and wave power. Thanks to numerous bike lanes, public transport services relying largely on electric trolley buses, and the widespread use of LED for street lighting, Vancouver has the lowest carbon emissions on the continent, outracing other major cities which failed to introduce equally effective solutions. It has also introduced a strict green code that all current residential construction developments must conform to. \r\n\r\nB. Oslo, Norway\r\nWith more than two-thirds of its municipality covered in forest, waterways and agricultural land, Oslo is one of Europe’s leading sustainable cities. Examples of pioneering practices include: intelligent lighting that dims when the weather and flow rate of vehicles permit, and eco-certification of work places involving 43,000 employees in companies, schools and kindergartens. Another green idea is the use of municipal waste to recover energy to heat offices and residential buildings. In fact, the city’s heating system is powered mainly by renewable energy, which annually saves carbon emissions equivalent to 60,000 vehicles. \r\n\r\nC. Curitiba, Brazil\r\nNamed the “Best Place to Live in Brazil,” Curitiba is regularly praised for its sustainability and conservation efforts. There are more than 52 square metres of green space per person, which means 1.5 million trees and a network of 28 parks. Some 2.3 million people a day use Curitiba’s fast transit service based on buses – a model of efficiency eagerly adopted by many other cities including Los Angeles.

During the excavations, they saw dark red smudges on the animal’s skin, which they thought might be mammoth blood.\r\nThe researchers then took the body to Yakutsk in Russia, where a group of experts had only three days to thoroughly examine the specimen before it was refrozen to prevent rotting. 5.2. _ Further tests conducted on the mammoth’s teeth revealed it was likely to have been in its mid-50s. While scientists were examining the elbow of the mammoth, blood samples were collected. Unlike humans and other mammals, mammoths evolved a cold-resistant form of hemoglobin, which enabled them to survive in the near-freezing temperatures during the Ice Age.\r\nThe discovery of the mammoth might be the key element enabling scientists to clone that extinct species. But whether or not Buttercup can be brought back to life is another matter. 5.3. _ Previously found mammoths looked exceptionally well-preserved but have yielded only a few dried specks of blood, and none of them had enough intact DNA for a cloning experiment. \r\nSo far, the team hasn’t found a complete copy of the mammoth’s genome. But Buttercup’s tissue has revealed some very long fragments of DNA that could potentially be pieced together to recreate the genome. 5.4. _ For example, George Churchen from Harvard University hopes that combining DNA from Buttercup with DNA from modern-day elephants will allow for that.

That’s the peculiar thing about nature,” explained Mr F. “It guards its rarest treasures with the greatest care. This noisy and fearful volcano has a mine at its feet. I am now leading you there.” With considerable difficulty we reached the foot of the volcano. We were suddenly standing on a piece of ground which didn’t move. At last! Feeling dizzy and weary, I was grateful to Mr F. for bringing me to a bench on this motionless piece of earth. I sat down and took a deep breath. The tension disappeared. Mr F. sat beside me for a while and then suggested that we get going. It took us about ten minutes to get to an entrance in the wall of the mountain, the entrance covered up by an old wooden door from a ship. Mr F. took out two pairs of glasses with dark lenses. “You’ll need these,” he explained, “and whatever you do, do not remove them while in the mines.” \r\n\r\nAs soon as I entered the mine, I understood why the ground above it was such a peaceful retreat in this rumbling landscape. The walls, the floor, the ceiling were hewn out of the hardest of all minerals: pure, dazzling diamond. I walked up to my ankles in diamond pebbles. The floor was covered with diamonds as big as cobblestones, diamonds in their cleanest state, ready to be cut. If the famous Jonkers’ diamond, one of the largest ever found, had been tossed on the brilliant floor of the Krakatoa mine, it would have been as impossible to find as a grain of salt in a bag of sugar. \r\n\r\nI was naturally astounded. I had seen pictures of the famous salt mines of Poland and the crystal caves of Bermuda. Here was a sight a thousand times more blinding, more awe-inspiring; a sight to make reality of the most imaginative fairy tale. \r\n\r\nI greedily picked up some of the jewels letting the smaller ones slip through my fingers. I couldn’t resist taking the biggest diamond in my hands. It was the size of a baseball. I suddenly felt like a small child let loose in a candy shop. I put the diamond away reluctantly. \r\n\r\n“May I have a handful of these?” I asked pointing to the diamond pebbles at my feet.

Here is the story. \r\n\r\nUntil the late nineteenth century, diamonds were found only in India and Brazil, and the entire world production of gem diamonds amounted to a few pounds a year. In 1870, however, huge diamond deposits were discovered in South Africa, where diamonds were soon being scooped out by the ton. The British financiers who had founded the South African mines quickly realized that their investment was endangered. They knew that diamond prices depended almost entirely on their scarcity so they feared that diamonds might become at best only semiprecious gems. \r\n\r\nThey needed something which would boost the demand for the stone. Help came in 1938 from a leading diamond merchandiser who launched well-orchestrated advertising and public-relations campaigns which aimed at creating emotional and romantic feelings towards diamonds. The skilful marketing enhanced the notion that diamonds were a gift of love: the larger and finer the diamond, the greater the love expressed. In three years diamond sales were up by 50%, but the merchandiser still needed a slogan that would express both the theme of romance and legitimacy. In 1947 the now classic slogan “A Diamond Is Forever” was coined. This immediately spurred even more sales. The implied durability of a diamond conveyed the meaning that marriage is forever. \r\n\r\nThe expression “a diamond is forever” is, however, more than just a catchy marketing slogan. Diamonds undoubtedly are the hardest of all gemstones. They have incredibly strong atom bonds because they are made up of carbon. Being the smallest of the atoms that can be bonded, carbon atoms fit together more tightly than atoms of any other element. Once these atoms have been compressed at high enough temperatures to form a diamond, they are literally bound forever, like marriage should be. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.thediamondauthority.org</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 61, "fields": {"category": 8, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "SOLD WITH THE HOUSE", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst.

According to his flatmate, a fellow New York University graduate, a massive Egyptian temple, twelve sphinxes and four statues of Ramses II were buried in the sands of the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes. “One evening, he told me this crazy story and I was thrilled. We thought it was a great idea for a documentary film. We hoped to find the city, dig it up and interview people who might know anything about its past,” Brosnan recalls.\r\n\r\nThe lost metropolis isn’t a strange Egyptian settlement, but a massive film set built in 1923 for  Cecil DeMille’s silent film The Ten Commandments. For this project DeMille needed a huge  Egyptian city in the desert. Before the age of computer-generated special effects, if you wanted a city in the desert, you had to build it. Before actors could start work, about 1500 workmen spent six weeks creating the set and when the filming ended, there wasn’t enough money to take it apart. DeMille did not want to leave it standing because he was afraid that other filmmakers might use it in their films. So, he told the workmen to hide the city beneath the sand dunes.\r\n\r\nTo find the set, Brosnan partnered with an archaeologist, John Parker, in 1990. They decided  to check the area with radar and they discovered that DeMille’s set was still there. Brosnan  asked the local authorities for permission to explore the site and had to wait two years for their  decision. And when he got the permit, he discovered that he didn’t have enough funds to carry  on with the project and gave up.  \r\n\r\nHowever, twenty years later, after the Los Angeles Times published an article about the project,  Brosnan got a call from a woman from Texas who was ready to sponsor the excavation. In 2012,  Brosnan returned to the dunes and some fragments of the city were uncovered. About one third  of the city was gone because the plaster used to create the set was extremely fragile. “It was  like working with a chocolate rabbit,” Peter Brosnan said when the first sphinx was found,  “anything we found could easily get damaged. After all, it was built to last three months during  filming in 1923 – not a century.” Before being moved from the site, the sphinx had to be sprayed  with strong glue and filled with stabilizing material. Scientists were afraid it might break into  pieces when someone touched it. Luckily, it didn’t and visitors can currently see it  in the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from http://thumbs.media.smithsonianmag.com; www.guardian.co.uk </i></p>\r\n1. dune – wydma", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 72, "fields": {"category": 7, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "A CLEVER IDEA", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto trzy zdania.

For those who haven’t heard, there is such a thing as aquarium therapy. Research findings suggest that watching fish may reduce muscle tension, pulse rate and other symptoms of stress. So you can imagine that guests who stay at the Manta Resort feel like a million dollars after soaking up the panoramic views of exotic sea life. This is made possible by the resort’s newly built underwater room costing $1,500 per night. Visitors can sunbathe on the upper-level sky deck, relax in the lounge at the water level or go down to the submerged chamber to fall asleep surrounded by the nightlight glow of jellyfish and other extraordinary creatures that swim by.\r\n\r\n<b>B</b>. The hotel complex is situated on Pemba Island’s westerly coastline, facing toward the serene stretch of ocean that separates the island from the mainland. Anchored to the sea floor about 820 feet offshore, where a large number of densely inhabited coral reefs surround the floating structure, the resort’s underwater room is as secluded as a vacation getaway can possibly be. The task of putting up the structure turned out to be physically and logistically demanding. The workers had to ship in all the various materials from Sweden, assemble the parts on the island and then tow the room to the site.\r\n\r\n<b>C</b>. The constructors’ aim was to build the hotel room in such a way that the endeavour would not have any negative impact on the ecosystem. Hence, solar panels supplying 100 per cent of the power needed were installed atop the roof deck of the room. In addition, the only people allowed inside are guests and assigned resort employees. It may seem unbelievable, but the hotel room will eventually turn into a coral reef itself. This makes it one of the few development projects beneficial to the marine environment.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 79, "fields": {"category": 11, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "WEARABLE TECH DEVICES", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto cztery fragmenty.

You stand in the fading light, a scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.\r\n\r\nThe ticket booth, clearly visible behind the gates, is sealed and barred.

The people around are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about finding someplace warmer to pass the evening.

Then comes the light. All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as if the entire circus was covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quietens as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with joy at the sight. When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the noise stops and the sign appears.\r\n\r\nThe letters, which are stretched across the top of the gates and hidden in curls of iron, are now slowly surfacing.

Passengers complained about the long waits at baggage reclaim. In response, the executives increased the number of baggage handlers working that shift. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes. But the complaints persisted. \r\n\r\nPuzzled, the airport executives undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found out that it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage reclaim and seven more minutes to get their bags. So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait times, it moved the arrival gates away from the main terminal and routed bags to the outermost carousel. Passengers now had to walk six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero. \r\n\r\nThis story hints at a general principle: the experience of waiting is defined only partly by the objective length of the wait. Research on queuing has shown that people overestimate how long they’ve waited in a line by about 36 percent. It’s been reported that one of the main factors determining how we feel about lines is our expectations. Uncertainty magnifies the stress of waiting, while feedback in the form of expected wait times and forecasts of delays eases the experience. And beating expectations lifts our mood. All else being equal, people who wait less than they anticipated leave happier than those who wait longer than expected. Professors Carmon and Kahneman have found that we are more concerned about how long a line is than how fast it’s moving. Given a choice between a slow-moving short line and a fast-moving long one, people opted for the former, even if the waits were identical. \r\n\r\nAmericans spend roughly 37 billion hours a year waiting in lines and complain a lot about it. I often wonder why queuing is so irritating. I’m inclined to think that in this era of constant rush, the dominant cost of waiting must be an emotional one: the nagging feeling of guilt that you are wasting your time, when you could be getting on with your business or be engaged in some creative endeavor. \r\n\r\nWe’ll never eliminate lines altogether but for me when all else fails, a gripping book is a way out. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.nytimes.com </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 82, "fields": {"category": 11, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "CHEERLEADING", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst.

But that’s what it has become.\r\n\r\nIt all started with John’s grandparents. They had built a hut on the lake in the mid-seventies. John used to go fishing there with his grandfather. “I wanted to share this place with my friends so I invited Brian, Mark, Dallas and David to join me there,” says John. “We finished high school and it was our last summer before going to college so we wanted to relax, have fun and forget about the responsibilities we were expected to take on.” The first photograph of the high school friends was just accidental. Brian grabbed John’s camera, gathered all his friends and set the self-timer to take a group photo. It showed five teens, three of them without their T-shirts on, with hairdos typical of the time. David is pictured holding a coffee jar with a cockroach inside, which the guys kept as a pet.\r\n\r\nThey went to Copco Lake again in 1987. One day when Brian set his camera to take a group photo, John suggested they could recreate the 1982 pose in the photo and together with Dallas worked on the details. And then Mark said it would be fun to do it every five years. The others liked his idea and in this way a tradition was born.\r\n\r\nIn the latest picture they took they are sitting in identical positions with unchanged, mysterious expressions on their faces. The day is cloudy just like in 1982, when the first photo was taken. David is holding a pet cockroach in a different jar, though. “We haven’t changed much since we were teenagers,” John laughs. “But we all decided this time it was better to take the photo with our T-shirts on.”\r\n\r\nSince the first photo together, the men have gone their own ways, but they all agree that those trips to the lake have been the glue that keeps them together. They do everything to meet every five years. They’ve even agreed to collect money if one of them isn’t able to afford the trip. “I remember one time my flight was cancelled and I drove all night to get to Copco Lake on time and pose for the photo,” Brian recalls. “We want to keep this tradition for the rest of our lives, no matter what. If one of us were in hospital, others would probably find a way to bring him there anyway,” he says jokingly.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from edition.cnn.com </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 93, "fields": {"category": 10, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "THE BEGINNINGS", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto trzy zdania.

Thirty thousand feet up, you are both God and ant. You survey the world beneath you as attentive staff serve refreshments and snacks. And yet you have no control over your own fate. You can’t exit and you can’t turn back. You are a hostage, at the mercy of others. Shocking as it may seem, this is what makes me love long flights, and especially watching movies on them. You have just a few options so you watch whatever is on, guilt-free. That’s how I have seen most romantic comedies in my life. I generally consider them a waste of time and at home I do all I can not to watch them, but in the air they become a true source of enjoyment. \r\n\r\nB. The regulations or personal tastes of the programme planners who work for airlines are a mystery to me. The choice often seems quite random. Just looking through the lists of what Air Canada considers avant-garde, contemporary or a new release is an entertainment in itself. But surely there are some guidelines, probably something like: if a film can’t cope with being viewed on a tiny screen, interrupted with beeps, meals, safety announcements and sudden drops in altitude, it has no place on a plane. \r\n\r\nC. There are some advantages, though. The movie goes straight from your individual screen into your brain, unfiltered by environmental factors. There are no strangers obstructing the view of the screen to those in the stalls behind, a partner commenting on the scene or kids munching popcorn. And while it’s rude to stare at what the commuter sitting next to you on the tube is watching or reading, on a plane you just can’t avoid it. Pop to the bathroom and as you return, you have no choice but to evaluate the personal taste of other travellers, whether you like it or not.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.theguardian.com</i></p>\r\n<b>In which paragraph does the author mention:</b>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 100, "fields": {"category": 14, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "THE MAPS OF THE FUTURE", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto cztery fragmenty.

Thanks to satellite navigation, GPS-enabled smartphones, social networking and 3D visualisation technology, maps are becoming almost unlimited in their functionality and capable of incorporating real-time updates. 5.1. _ For instance, tourists will be able to plan their trips by using their phones to project a 3D map onto a wall. Then they’ll be able to manipulate it remotely with their fingers, adding layers of information such as landmarks, restaurants, recommendations from friends, as well as transport links and times. As digital maps can now be linked to an almost infinite number of data sets, they’re also going to become more personalised. Cyclists or surfers, for example, will be able to add whatever information they find relevant. And soon we may not only be visualising maps. 5.2. _ This kind of function in a map would also be an obvious advantage for people whose sight is impaired.\r\n\r\nNot only does geo-location help us know where we are and what there is of interest around us, it can also show us where everyone else is, and what they think is useful and interesting. 5.3. _ Consequently, we receive real-time alerts from fellow drivers, and hopefully enjoy a less frustrating journey. In my area, over 1,500 motorists drove 105,000 miles and posted and shared 528 road alerts in the last week alone. Of course, a system based on collecting data from users’ posts works better when more people take part, so if the number is smaller, it might not always be 100% reliable. 5.4. _ National emergency services spring to mind first when one thinks of the users of the more precise, dynamically-updated maps which are currently available.\r\n\r\nWhile new interaction technologies are making maps richer, there is still one underlying theme uniting all maps throughout history – location.

Part of me was angry, however, another part of me began to see I had an opportunity to put the past behind me. I knew I couldn’t carry on singing on street corners all my life. I had to move on.\r\nThat was all very well in theory, of course. But no one was going to give me a job. It wasn’t because I was stupid, I knew that. Thanks to the IT work I’d done when I was a teenager back in Australia, I was fairly knowledgeable when it came to computers. But I didn’t have any relevant experience in the UK to rely on and if a prospective employer asked me where I’d spent the past ten years, I wouldn’t be able to say I’d been working for Google or Microsoft. So I had to forget that. There wasn’t even any point in my applying to do a training course in computing because they wouldn’t accept me. I had been homeless for years and didn’t even have an O level to my name. \r\nI realised that there was only one option – selling the Big Issue1 . I didn’t have the luxury of waiting for something else to turn up. So the next day I set off for Covent Garden. I had to find Sam, the area’s Big Issue coordinator. \r\nSelling the Big Issue is not easy. People often come up to you and say “get a job”. They think that the sellers are given the magazines for free but it’s not the case. The philosophy of the Big Issue is “you have to have money to make money”. You get a small number of free magazines only on the first day. Once you’ve sold them, you purchase further copies for £1.25 and sell them for £2.50, thereby making a £1.25 income per copy. You need to plan carefully how many magazines you buy every day because if you make no money, you can’t afford copies to sell the next day. \r\nI had tried it once, yet, for me it hadn’t worked out. I gave it up after a few months but I could still remember some of the grim, monotonous days I’d spent trying to tempt Londoners to part with their cash in return for a magazine. But I’d been invisible. They would turn their backs on me or do all they could to avoid me. That’s why I’d turned to busking, at least then I had my music to attract people’s attention. \r\nI wouldn’t have considered going back to selling the Big Issue if it hadn’t been for my cat, Bob. He had transformed my fortunes on the street incredibly. If I could do as well selling the Big Issue as I’d done busking with Bob, then my life would take a turn for the better.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from A Street Cat Named Bob by James Bowen </i></p>\r\n<i>1 Big Issue – a magazine published on behalf of and sold by homeless people. </i>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 102, "fields": {"category": 14, "type": "listening", "layout": "quiz", "title": "WALKING DOGS FOR A LIVING", "text": "Gazing out on a sunny summer day from behind the office desks, there are few people who have never thought of being a river guide or a rancher. For many dog lovers, those outdoorsy dreams concern dog walking. \r\n\r\nIt’s a common misconception that dog walking is undemanding. No doubt this illusion stems from the humble beginnings of the profession. Once upon the 1960s, people simply paid the kid down the street a dollar to take Fido out for them. As we’ve packed ourselves into tighter urban spaces with growing crime rates and heavier traffic, the risks involved in a kid walking Fido no longer allow for that solution. But pet owners have even less time and available space to walk Fido, who still needs regular, vigorous exercise beyond what he can get in our small backyards. That’s why professional dog walking was born. And a professional is what it takes to safely navigate six to eight unruly dogs through heavily used natural spaces. \r\n\r\nUnaware of the hardships, many walkers start out with the experience of walking their own pets. Soon they realize the job involves more than it’s commonly believed. It starts with having the appropriate licences. It’s about interacting skillfully with other trail users and knowing what to do if a fight breaks out. Bad weather brings its own set of trials such as cleaning up soaked and muddy pets. That, however, is not all there is to dog walking. Most of all, it is a business like any other and as such it involves paperwork, customer service, accounting, and an endless list of rules and regulations most of us are not aware of. \r\n\r\nStill, a lot of dog walkers think they have the best job in the world.

Tolkien</i></p>\r\nI fell in love with New Zealand on my first visit in 2003. New Line Cinema called to offer me a small role in The Lord of the Rings, a film based on my great-grandfather’s novel. Of course, I accepted. I was excited to see what was happening behind the scenes. Watching how such a film is created, how the scenes are shot and put together, was so inspirational that when I returned to Britain, I decided to get involved in film production.\r\n\r\nI watched the final version of The Lord of the Rings on screen a few months later. It was amazing to see how my great-grandfather’s ideas were shown in the film and what amazing special effects were used. What Peter Jackson and all the cast did with his books is beyond words. The team presented brilliantly that special atmosphere achieved by my great-grandfather. The effect is so powerful, as if New Zealand had been lifted straight from the pages of his books.\r\n\r\nSince that first trip in 2003 I’ve been obsessed with that country. I’ve been back six times and tried to use every opportunity to experience different aspects of life there. The last time I went there to work on my own film and I was lucky enough to stay for three whole months. Although I spent most of the time in Peter Jackson’s wonderful film centre in Wellington, I also had the chance to travel out of town. The landscapes were amazing wherever I went fishing, swimming or climbing.\r\n\r\nWhen I’m travelling, local cuisine is always part of the experience for me. New Zealand has a lot to offer in this respect but if I had to choose just one place, it would be the Chocolate Fish Café in Shelly Bay. The location on the seashore is an advantage but that’s not what makes the place crowded with tourists every weekend. They come here for the impossibly good coffee and a great selection of fresh barbecued octopus, fish, crabs and oysters, tastier than anywhere else in the area. But despite the name, chocolate is not their speciality. For desserts you’d better go somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, New Zealand has something for everybody. Tourists can bungee-jump off a bridge, ride a jet boat down a river, sunbathe on its beautiful beaches or walk in its glorious mountains. If you love nature, don’t hesitate. Do it with or without a guidebook, but do it all, or you’ll miss the best adventure of your life.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.telegraph.co.uk</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 114, "fields": {"category": 13, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "EMBARRASSING MEETING", "text": "Przeczytaj tekst, z którego usunięto trzy zdania.

Police officers conducted the stammering traffic along the designated route. Freshmen and parents lugged suitcases and boxes heaped with bedding, posing for photos before the red-brick dormitories with the shameless glee of tourists. A pair of lanky boys sailed a Frisbee over late-summer grass in lazy parabolas. \r\nA timpani concerto pounded in my chest as we made landfall upon the hallowed ground that had been locked in my sights for years. We’d arrived. I’d arrived. \r\n“For the tuition we’re paying,” my father said, carefully reversing into a spot, “you’d think they could give us more than twenty minutes to park.” \r\nMy parents climbed out of the car and circled around to the popped trunk. After tugging in vain at my door handle, I tapped on the window. “Where’d he go?” I could hear my mother ask. \r\n“In here,” I shouted, knocking louder.\r\n“Sorry, thought you got out,” my father said following my liberation.\r\nI checked in under a white tent and received my room key, a bulky orientation packet and an ID card. It read David Alan Federman, Harvard Student. When we reached Matthew Hall, we shuffled to the fourth floor. The doors were marked with signs listing the occupants and their hometowns, stamped with Harvard’s Veritas shield. \r\nMy roommate, Steven Zenger, had yet to arrive. I claimed the front room, envisioning it would lead to impromptu visitors, a revolving door of campus characters popping in, lounging on my bed, gossiping late into the night. \r\nMy parents took my student card and fetched the remaining stuff as I unpacked. “Well,” said my mother after setting down the final box. “This is exciting. I wish I were starting college again.” \r\n“And I bet you’ll find your tribe,” my father added. “You’ll have a great time here,” he said with the hollow brightness of an appliance manual congratulating you on your purchase. \r\n“Yep.” Sensing more imperatives and prophecies, which I was fed up with, I opened the door to let them out. After our own swift hug, my mother pushed my father into initiating an avuncular, back-patting clinch and they left. \r\nThe door swung shut with a muted click. I resumed unpacking, yanking the price tags off a few items. I was standing inside my closet, hanging shirts, when the door flew open and my roommate bounded into the room, his equally enthusiastic parents in tow. \r\n“David!” he said. “Almost didn’t see you. I’m Steven.” He walked over with his arm puppetishly bobbing for me to shake.  \r\n“If I look different from my Facebook photo, it’s because I got braces again last week,” he said. “But just for six months. Or five and three quarters now.”  \r\nAll hopes I had of a roommate who would upgrade me to a higher social stratum snagged on the gleaming barnacles of Steven’s orthodontia. I could sit back and laugh at the irony of it. He would have fit right in at my cafeteria table at Garret Hobart High, where I sat with a miscellaneous coalition of outcasts who had banded together less out of friendship than survival instinct. We rarely associated outside of school and sheepishly nodded when passing in the halls, aware that each of us somehow reduced the standing of the other. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from Loner by Teddy Wayne</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 121, "fields": {"category": 6, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "DON’T RUSH WITH YOUR MAJOR", "text": "May 1st is traditionally the deadline for high school seniors in the US to finally make a decision about where they’re going to college in the fall. In the coming months, seniors and their parents will inevitably be tormented with questions about the choice of school they made. Such questions are more than often followed by this one: What’s your major going to be? Even in today’s fast-moving economy, where industries expand and contract at an alarming pace, students are often asked to select a major at 18. But the truth is that most college freshmen really have a rather vague idea of what they want to do, even if they declare a major before they arrive on campus. \r\n\r\nThat’s why a quarter of freshmen change their major by the end of their first year of college and around 50% say they intend to change it. Some students hedge their bets by picking two majors, one they favor and one they think might offer them better career prospects and a bigger paycheck. At some elite schools, the ranks of double majors now make up 30 to 40 percent of graduates. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, given the rising price of a college education, too many decisions about majors these days are driven by the expected return on investment after graduation. Lifetime earnings between bachelor degree recipients can vary greatly depending on the major. According to a study released by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, graduates with the highest-paying major (petroleum engineering) earn $3.4 million more than those with the lowest-paying major (early childhood education) during the course of a career. The study, which analyzed wages for 137 college majors, found that of the 25 highest-paying majors, all were in either the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and maths) or business and economics.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tony Carnevale, the director of the Georgetown Center, warns students who pick their majors solely on the basis of the expected paycheck not to count their money too quickly because salaries differ greatly within majors. He notes, for example, that the top quarter earners who majored in humanities or the liberal arts make more than the bottom quarter of engineering majors. \r\n\r\nIf freshmen see majors as flexible, they should be encouraged to explore their options in their first year of college to see what actually interests them. There’s no need to rush the decision. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.independent.co.uk</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 122, "fields": {"category": 6, "type": "reading", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "LIVING BENEATH THE WAVES", "text": "Read the article.

His even tan hints at his lifetime of outdoor ventures. The wood-paneled walls around Koblick’s office are filled with memorabilia that attest to his years as an undersea pioneer.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries, the idea of housing human divers on the seabed was unthinkable. 5.2. _ In order to avoid painful internal injuries and even death, typical dives to modest depths of, say, up to 100 feet lasted only minutes, not the days or weeks that would be necessary to live and work out of a seafloor habitat. But then, a U.S. Navy doctor, George Bond, caused a stir by questioning the conventional diving limits. He and his team started to test the concept known as saturation diving, which turned out to be the key to prolonged underwater stays.\r\n\r\nKoblick was among the early converts to the concept of undersea living when it came of age in the 1960s. 5.3. _ The nascent quest to equip aquanauts to live in “inner space,” as some called the vast undersea realm, never got anything close to the billions of dollars pumped into launching the Apollo astronauts into outer space, but it still turned into a cutting-edge industry.\r\n\r\nKoblick may sound like a romantic dreamer for his enduring belief in the value of seabed habitats and his persistent efforts, over many years, to create new ones.

One paragraph does not match any of the questions. \r\n\r\nIS THE LUXURY OF HOME WORKING A MYTH?\r\n\r\nA. Dreaming of escaping the shackles of your office and working from home? Beware. Many people who turn this fantasy into reality find themselves having to endure cramped conditions. Running away from the office and hiding behind a home computer is all the rage as more and more companies adopt flexible working practices. Around eight million people in the UK have already decided to avoid the dubious delights of delayed trains, contraflows and office politics by setting up an office in the privacy of their own homes.\r\n\r\nB. Keen home workers wax lyrical about the benefits of taking a break whenever they feel like it. However, unless you are wealthy enough to build an office extension, working from home can be a fast track to job dissatisfaction. According to a survey by Lexmark, fewer than 50% of employees are pleased with their home office space, with a quarter of them forced to work in the kitchen, 37% in the spare room and 10% ‘hotdesking’ it wherever they can find a place. The distant memory of your former air-conditioned workplace or chatting with workmates around the water cooler may seem all the sweeter when you’re sitting alone in the cellar or in a tiny room at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nC. Over three quarters of home workers have found themselves in cluttered surroundings, and over 50% of those surveyed acknowledged they suffered from lack of space and consequently were unable to work effectively. Over a third were confined to a room with no natural light. Despite this sobering reality, most people still believe that the upsides of home working outweigh the downsides. Freedom and flexibility to choose your working hours, with no one watching over you, are enough to persuade people to put up with the more inconvenient aspects.\r\n\r\nD. Still, working from home is a bit of an oxymoron. Homes are destined for families and relaxation. Establishing an office there can spoil the ambience. Filing cabinets and printers look incongruous next to a sofa. The high-tech age that has freed up employees has resulted in their floors being scattered with cables linking to PCs, scanners, fax machines, copiers, and a huge mountain of chargers. “I set up a mini office in the corner of my lounge. The key to working from home is to make sure your makeshift office doesn’t take away from the rest of the house,” says a London-based translator.\r\n\r\nE. The ideal solution is to soup up your garden shed if you have one. There are companies sprouting up that can even design one for you. The managing director of one of them remarks that their sales have doubled as plenty of firms are basing their workforces at home to save money on renting office space. “Our customer base is changing towards the people kicked out from their corporate base.” After all, regardless of the potential downsides, tripping up on a daisy on the way to your desk could be the closest you ever come to experiencing a stressful journey to work.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from http://discovermagazine.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 124, "fields": {"category": 6, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "CONMAN OR ARTIST?", "text": "Read the text.

Each morning I walked the tree-lined streets near the tennis courts, passing boisterous teenagers queued up for leftover passes. Outside the gate was a news-stand that sold British tabloids, featuring paparazzi photos of supermodels, celebrities and the royal family, horoscopes and a wee bit of actual news. Their top headline of the day was written on a chalkboard, and usually read something like ROYAL COUPLE IN TROUBLE! or GAZZA TO TEAM: GIVE ME MILLIONS! \r\n\r\nPeople scooped up these tabloids, devoured their gossip, and on previous trips to England, I had always done the same. But now, with Morrie’s illness at the back of my mind, whenever I confronted anything silly or mindless, I kept picturing my friend in his tiny house with his loved ones, while I spent so many hours on things that meant absolutely nothing to me personally: movie stars, football players or the latest noise out of Prince Charles or Madonna. Back home, the O.J. Simpson trial was in full swing, and there were people who surrendered their entire lunch hour to follow it. I started to wonder why we bothered so much with the lives of strangers. \r\n\r\nOne particularly crazy day in Wimbledon, a crush of reporters had tried to chase down Andre Agassi and his famous girlfriend, Brooke Shields, and I had gotten knocked over by a British reporter who barely muttered “Sorry” before sweeping past. I thought of something Morrie had told me: “So many people walk around with meaningless lives. They seem half-asleep, even when they are busy doing things they think are important. This is because they are chasing the wrong things.” \r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Detroit, I arrived late in the afternoon, dragged myself home and went to sleep. I awoke to a jolting piece of news: the unions at my newspaper had gone on strike. There were picketers at the front entrance and marchers chanting up and down the street. As a member of the union, I had no choice. I was suddenly out of a job, out of a paycheck, and pitted against my employers. Union leaders called my home and warned me against any contact with my former editors, many of whom were my friends. I was also told to hang up if they rang me up and tried to plead their case. I felt confused and depressed. Although the TV and radio work were nice supplements, the newspaper had been my lifeline, my oxygen. When I saw my stories in print each morning, I knew that I was alive. Now it was gone. And as the strike continued, there were phone calls and rumors that this could drag on. There were sporting events each night that I would have gone to cover. Instead, I stayed home and watched them on TV. I had grown used to thinking readers somehow needed my column, so I was stunned at how easily things went on without me. Suddenly, I thought of Morrie again and decided to call him. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 132, "fields": {"category": 9, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "MY EARLY RETIREMENT", "text": "The life expectancy of the average UK male is 74. Hearing about government plans to hike state pensionable age, I realized that not much time might be left to enjoy the life of a pensioner. That’s why, last August, I decided to retire at the age of 33. I gave up my job as a journalist, rented out my London flat and moved to the south-west of France with my girlfriend, who heartily agreed with my plan. It was fear and a tinge of weariness that gave me the impulse to do it. ① I worried that I was wasting the best years of my life blinking at a computer screen and that when I did eventually pack up work, I would have hours to kill but no energy or strength to make use of them. The solution seemed obvious, if a little risky: retire now and work later. \r\n\r\nMany will think me foolhardy, as did some of my friends, not to mention bosses. But I want to enjoy life in my prime. I have worked hard. I started as a journalist at 17. Early shifts, night shifts, weekends, bank holidays and Christmases: check. And what was it all for? ② I got halfway up the ladder and realized I was afraid of heights – or to be precise, of professional responsibility and the attendant drudgery. \r\n\r\nSome doubts I had obviously harboured were allayed when it transpired that with the income from my London flat, a modest, stress-free life in France was a realistic possibility. Modest being the operative word. ③ In return, here we are in France, having spent the winter reading books by the wood burner. A hectic life and economic blues have been swapped for country walks and fireside chats. Stress has been reduced to wondering which route to take or whether the fire will crackle into life. \r\n\r\nThere are risks, of course. I’m not as fortunate as some of my colleagues who can take on a contract whenever they fancy, so work is not guaranteed when I decide to return to London. And another question mark is about successful repatriation. ④ If a job is found, how to overcome the daily grind of self-doubt, to tolerate the early-morning starts and office politics once more? Still, it’ll surely be worth it for the sweltering Monday afternoons when I can sit by the pool with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice in hand, listening to the birds singing and the rustle of leaves.

There is one fragment which you do not need to use. \r\n\r\nHOW DO EMOTICONS AND CAPITALISATION AFFECT PERCEPTION OF EMAIL?\r\n\r\nCompared with face-to-face communication, nonverbal cues in email are lacking. But humans are fabulous at generating meaning even when cues are sparse. A group of psychologists from Stanford University have put forward a theory that our motivation for generating meaning is to reduce levels of uncertainty and help predict other people’s behavioural patterns. 5.1. _ Both of these enable the people we are addressing to predict our behaviour, mood and intentions. \r\n\r\nThe research on nonverbal behaviour in emails is not as simple as “emoticons are good while capitalisation is bad”. It seems that both writing in capital letters and using emoticons can evoke utterly different responses, perhaps much less polarised in the case of capitalisation, which is normally considered a no-no in emails. However, the usage of capital letters can also communicate excitement and not just senseless shouting. 5.2. _ Perhaps some of this variability in the perception of capitalisation and emoticons comes down to personality? \r\n\r\nPsychologists researched this by asking college students to fill in a personality questionnaire and then read emails from an unknown person. These were simple messages such as requests for copies of academic papers or information about the university. Each participant was randomly assigned to read two out of several differently presented emails. 5.3. _ The students were then asked to rate the sender’s likeability. \r\n\r\nThe researchers found that the reader’s personality influenced how emoticons and capitalisation were perceived. Readers high in extroversion and emotional stability were likely to rate the sender’s emails as more likeable if they had correct capitalisation and emoticons. The opposite was also true. For the introverted and emotionally unstable, correct capitalisation and emoticons tended not to affect the sender’s likeability, perhaps even lowering it. These results are interesting but they also raise many more questions. Emoticons may make the sender appear more likeable, but further research is necessary to find out if they also make the sender seem less professional or whether they can make reading bad news less disturbing. In their study, the researchers only used a smiley face in the emails. 5.4. _ These are just some uncertainties. If more advanced ways of communicating emotion in email become a reality, surely many more questions will have to be answered. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from www.spring.org.uk</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 134, "fields": {"category": 9, "type": "reading", "layout": "reading-table", "title": "LET’S MOVE TO MARS!", "text": "Read the text.

Imagine a luxurious hotel with a view that’s changing all the time, where there are 18 sunrises and sunsets every day and where food floats effortlessly into your mouth. Who wouldn’t sign up for that? It’s only a matter of time before space travel becomes a regular holiday option. We might even start living and working on the Moon.

More people travel to space for increasingly longer periods of time and their physical environment and its psychological effects are becoming more and more important. Surprisingly, the US space station, Skylab, which orbited the Earth from 1973 to 1979 and was recycled out of the fuel tank of a massive Saturn V rocket, remains by far the most generous habitat sent into orbit. It was palatial compared with the poky modules of the current International Space Station. \r\n\r\n<b>C</b>. However, luxury is not an issue at this stage. First an efficient way to construct dwellings has to be invented. It would cost $500,000 to send a single brick to the Moon and lots more to Mars. As a result, the task has always been to develop lightweight materials and kits, that is to take a kind of astro-Ikea approach. Engineers’ attention is now shifting towards inflatable structures, allowing entire habitats to be folded up and packed on board. \r\n\r\n<b>D</b>. In 1974, Guillermo Trotti put forward a proposal for an inflatable habitat on the Moon. His lunar colony envisaged a network of domes and structures to house a community of 200 people. It never blasted off but it inspired other ideas. The current catchphrase among NASA people is in-situ resource utilisation, the space equivalent of using locally available resources. The surface of the Moon (and probably that of Mars as well) is an open mine of readily accessible minerals and compounds that could be used in construction projects. \r\n\r\n<b>E</b>. Trotti is optimistic about life on Mars, arguing that deep-space exploration will be the largest industry in the world over the next 100 years, as well as the biggest challenge for budding space architects.

The adjectives commonly used are ‘good’ and ‘plain’, with the latter being used as an insult as much as a compliment, sometimes with some justification. Yet, plain food cannot be bettered if its quality is right and the freshness palpable. And British food certainly wasn’t all that plain for most of its history! An interesting question to ponder is how the inherently conservative people of the British Isles have come to accept and encourage influences from all round the world throughout centuries, and still do so at an ever-increasing rate. You have only to consider that one entire generation believes that the Chinese take-away, tandoori chicken, spaghetti, kebabs and hamburgers they love so much are all British. The generation just older than them will think longingly of British cooking as baked apples and sweet cured hams, of the mellowness of cinnamon and the bite of cloves in baking, and of peppery beef stews, without ever realizing that the ingredients which make them so special – the spices – are all imported from far-away eastern lands. \r\n\r\nThe earliest cooked food in Britain was meat roasted over flames, and gruels of grains, sometimes flavoured with vegetables and herbs. The first contact with spices was during the long Roman occupation, but when the Romans left and the Dark Ages cast their pall over Europe, the British returned to a less sophisticated style of food. The most monumental change came with the last successful invasion of these shores by the Duke of Normandy. As well as introducing new and more luxurious styles of cooking, the Normans also gave us many new words for food, for instance pork and beef. And after the Normans came the Crusaders who reintroduced spices to Britain and also brought with them sugar, dried fruit and rose water. Over the centuries, the rise and fall of a dozen empires and kingdoms have made their contribution to British food. For generations Britain has taken what has been offered, chewed it over and kept what it liked the most. \r\n\r\nI hope you will be surprised at this book. When gathering material, I was certainly surprised many times. For instance, at how quickly foods which have been common for centuries can disappear. Why did we stop using rose water about 60 years ago, or flavouring our custards with bay leaf or orange? Is it a silly snobbishness that led to the virtual disappearance of the once envied British puddings based on breadcrumbs? \r\n\r\nI hope you will use the recipes included in this book judiciously, altering the proportion of ingredients as it suits you – but without moving away from the spirit of the dish. Spirit seems to me to be the great link between the extraordinarily different styles of British food. Through this book we can follow in our predecessors’ footsteps with respect and with the lightness of our own touch.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from The Cooking of the British Isles by Glynn Christian</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 143, "fields": {"category": 12, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "COOKING ENCOUNTERS", "text": "Lillian loved best the moment before she turned on the lights. She would stand in the restaurant kitchen doorway, rain-soaked air behind her, and let the smells come to her – ripe sourdough yeast or garlic, mellowing as it lingered. Lillian breathed in, feeling the smells move about and through her, even as she searched out those that might reveal whether the new assistant chef was still double-dosing the curry in the dishes. She was. The girl was good enough with knives, but some days, Lillian thought with a sigh, <b>it was like trying to teach subtlety to a thunderstorm.</b> \r\n\r\nTonight was Monday, a cooking class night. Lillian’s students arrived with a variety of motivations, some drawn by a yearning as yet unmet to hear murmured culinary compliments, others trying to find a cook rather than become one. A few participants who had been given the course as a gift, had no desire for lessons at all, arriving as if on a forced march to certain failure; they knew their cakes would always be flat, their cream sauces filled with small, disconcerting pockets of flour. And then there were those students who seemingly had no choice, who could no more stay out of a kitchen than a kleptomaniac could keep her hands in her pockets. They fantasized about leaving their corporate jobs and becoming chefs with an exhilarating mixture of guilt and pleasure. They always came early and stayed late. If Lillian’s soul sought out this last group, it was only to be expected, but in truth, she found them all fascinating. \r\n\r\nIt was during her early years that Lillian discovered cooking. After her father left, housework became for Lillian’s mother a travel destination rarely reached; laundry, a friend one never remembered to call. Lillian picked up these skills by following her friends’ mothers around their homes, while the mothers pretended not to notice, dropping hints about bleach or changing a vacuum bag as if it were just one more game children played. Lillian learned, and soon developed a certain domestic routine. But it was the cooking that occurred in her friends’ homes that fascinated Lillian the most – the aromas that started calling to her just when she had to go home in the evening. \r\n\r\nLillian liked thinking about smells. She often remembered the time Margaret’s mother had let her help with a white sauce, playing out the memory in her head the way some children try to recover, bit by bit, the moments of a favourite birthday party. Margaret had pouted, because she was never allowed to help in the kitchen, but Lillian had ignored all twinges of loyalty and climbed up on the chair and stood, watching the butter melt across the pan like the farthest reach of a wave sinking into the sand. Then she gazed at the flour, at first a hideous, clumping thing destroying the image until it was stirred with Margaret’s mother’s hand over Lillian’s on the wooden spoon when she wanted to mash the clumps, moving slowly, in circles until the flour-butter became smooth and until again the image was changed by the added milk.

Cultures stretching from Central America to the Far East, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, have used it both as a powerful medicine and as a medium for exquisite jewellery and fine works of art. \r\n\r\nToday, scientists value amber even more than artists. 5.1. _ And unlike ordinary fossils, which are relatively crude rock molds of prehistoric life forms, these specimens are often perfectly preserved, with the most delicate features intact. \r\n\r\nRecently David Grimaldi, an entomologist of New York City’s Museum of Natural History, has announced a discovery he calls ‘scientifically the most important of all amber fossils’. 5.2. _ That makes them the oldest intact plants ever found in a piece of amber, and an important clue to the origin of the plants that now dominate the earth. \r\n\r\nThe resin that eventually turns into amber comes from a variety of ancient trees, mostly conifers, including pines and extinct relatives of sequoias and cedars, but also some deciduous trees. It probably evolved as a defense against wood-boring insects. As it dripped down the bark, it acted like flypaper and encapsulated them, hermetically sealing the trees’ wounds at the same time. Apart from these creatures, which must have been its target, the resin would also trap anything else that happened to stumble into it. 5.3. _ Thanks to this abundance of samples surely some important insights into the workings of natural selection can be revealed.\r\n\r\nAs anybody who has seen the film Jurassic Park knows, plants and animals sealed in amber are a potential source of prehistoric DNA. Scientists have extracted genetic material from, among other things, a 17 million-year-old magnolia and a 120 million-year-old beetle. Yet, no serious biologist believes it will ever be possible to clone a dinosaur from just a few bits of DNA. Even so excellent a preservative as amber apparently can’t keep DNA from breaking down into fragments that may be scientifically interesting but are biologically inert. 5.4. _ One thing is certain, though. Whereas for artists any piece of amber is an uncut gem, for scientists only ones with a sample of a prehistoric life form trapped inside are exciting.  \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from Time, 2006 </i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 145, "fields": {"category": 12, "type": "reading", "layout": "reading-table", "title": "A TALE OF TWO CITIES", "text": "Read the text.

It’s hard to pinpoint the exact moment when San Francisco morphed into bizarro-world New York, when it became, in many ways, more New York-ish than New York itself − its wealth more impressive, its infatuation with power and status more blinding. Maybe it was when, after the crash, bonus-starved Wall Street bankers started quitting their jobs and flocking to the Bay Area in droves to join the start-up gold rush. Or maybe it was when San Francisco was announced to have the least affordable mortgage rates in the country. \r\n\r\nB. It’s no secret that New York is having a bit of an identity crisis these days. Wall Street lost its swagger during the crash and hasn’t gotten it back. Big banks are adding employees in Salt Lake City while cutting them in Manhattan. New York City’s budget experts expect the city to add only 67,000 jobs next year, a sluggish number that faster-growing cities like Denver and Austin will look upon with pity. The city’s culture seems to be changing, too: uniformity and neutrality are in, high heels and striped suits are out; junior bankers now get Saturdays off; “work-life balance” is no longer synonymous with laziness. \r\n\r\nC. Meanwhile, certain pockets of San Francisco have become the sort of gilded playground that New York once was. Paper millionaires spend their nights at the Battery, a members-only club with a tech-heavy roster and a $10,000-per-night penthouse suite. Upscale restaurants pop up at regular intervals, each with a more elite clientele and a hipster menu − everything from avocado and goat cheese toast to fancy dinners including sustainable seafood. \r\n\r\nD. In many ways, San Francisco is the nation’s new success theater. It’s the city where dreamers go to prove themselves − the place where just being able to afford a normal life serves as an indicator of courage and ability. I had lunch the other day with a Harvard Business School student who belonged to a 90-person section, of whom 12 were start-up entrepreneurs. You can imagine the whole dozen packing their bags for the West Coast after collecting their MBAs, conceitedly thinking: I can make it there. And if I make it there, I’ll make it anywhere. \r\n\r\nE. San Francisco hasn’t pulled off this transition effortlessly. The city still has its lefty legacy, after all, and as the tech sector has grown into an economic powerhouse, so has resentment toward its elites. Residents, angry about the rising costs and widening inequality, are blockading tech-employee shuttles in the streets. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, long suspected of being in the tech industry’s pocket, is accused of not doing enough to help the working class cope with the problems of the local economy. Silicon Valley is exploding, as Wall Street did in the 1980s and as Detroit did in the 1940s. And as in those booms, not everyone is going along for the ride.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from http://nymag.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 146, "fields": {"category": 12, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "LONDON HOUSE PRICES LEAP", "text": "Read the text.

He had imagined he would get used to it: that his palm, curved around the handle of the thin black whip, would cease to sweat, and that his chest would cease to feel constricted by the glittering silver leotard. He had always dusted his armpits with talc; shifting from foot to foot he felt the wet mineral slippery on his skin. He inhaled, flexed his arms and watched the muscle bunch like the back of a dolphin curving through water. The smell reminded him of his childhood. His father used to take him to the circus every year; there was a troupe that came each spring and set up their tent on the village green. His father bought him candyfloss and peanuts and they sat rapt, admiring the artists and their feats of daring. \r\n\r\nAcross from him, on the other side of the tent, they were rolling out the cages, one by one, linking them together to form a train of ferocity. It was quite dark in the wings, he could not see very clearly, but he could make out the shapes in the cages, moving, twisting in their small spaces, and pressing their fur against the bars. He knew they sensed his presence as much as he did theirs, and it made a vivid bridge between them, across the tent, across the ring, waiting for the moment they would meet. At the moment when the cages were opened, the ranks of seething, fidgety people usually became still, watching his glittering smoothness move so easily among the huge beasts. They would think he had tamed them with his whip and his strength, but that was not so. He knew that things could always happen. After all the cats were wild. The sweat trickled down between his shoulders as he watched the clowns roll about the ring or run up and down in the dimness of the audience.\r\n\r\nIt was almost time. Standing in the corner, the ringmaster was adjusting his brilliant coat, pulling on his tie, clearing his throat. In their cages the cats waited. The ringmaster strode into the ring. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen!’ he called. ‘The moment you have all been waiting for! What more can I say? He needs no introduction. I give you The Great Leonardo!’ \r\n\r\nA little hop off his toes and he was running into the light, his arms and chest wide, his legs pushing him gracefully out into the centre ring, seeing the cages out of the corner of his eye roll to meet him. The clowns and roustabouts pulled the barred train into a semi-circle behind him as he bowed deeply, his head nearly brushing the sawdust on the ring floor, his face set still and stern. The crowd – from here they looked like bubbles on the surface of turbulent water – shouted and whistled and clapped, twirled their brightly glowing torches upwards to make small acres of spinning light. \r\n\r\nThe Great Leonardo let one arm drop slowly to his side and brought the other hand to his mouth, one finger on his lips, in an exaggerated gesture for silence. There was whispering, shuffling, giggles, and then quiet. He never spoke during the course of his act. The previous lion tamer, Cat Man, had been hard of hearing, and had trained the animals with a series  of gestures and claps without ever touching them. Cat Man had, however, spoken to the audience. To keep them on tenterhooks, he told them of dangerous acts of daring, of the extraordinary cunning of the animals and warned them of what was to come. The Great Leonardo did not open his mouth. He clapped his hands twice. The roustabouts jumped to the front of the cages and turned the keys in their locks. The doors opened in a repeating curve, the roustabouts slipped out of the ring, and the cats glided out of their cages to sit in a circle around him. The audience began to applaud, and then, recalling his gesture, rustled quickly into silence. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>adapted from The Great Leonardo by Erica Wagner</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 155, "fields": {"category": 15, "type": "reading", "layout": "quiz", "title": "DOES THE CIRCUS HAVE A FUTURE?", "text": "When we founded the Big Apple Circus in the 1970s, we knew we were addressing an audience that had grown up watching television. Today, audiences have grown up in front of computer screens and video games. Patrons’ attention spans are shorter, and their lives are busier and full of other entertainment options. This fact invariably leads us to ask: is the circus still relevant, and can it remain so? The circus has survived for centuries, like the flood, pestilence or famine that haunt the human race. Its antecedents can be traced to prehistory and were at the heart and soul of the tribal cultures that existed in those times. ① Indeed, the circus is part of our humanity as its arts address our continual struggle for survival. Watching an acrobat throw a triple somersault affirms our uncanny ability to look improbability in the face and to jump, knowing that a net will appear. \r\n\r\nThe circus, over millennia, has proven itself to be a resilient art form. ② The Big Apple Circus, European in style but American in its energy and rhythm, is part of a worldwide phenomenon attesting to that resilience. When I consider how the circus might have to adapt to a changing audience and a shifting world, I’m not overly concerned. ③ For instance, the circus was one of the first institutions in America to use electric lights. It’s likely that the circus of the year 2050 will have to shorten its moments, maybe even the length of the entire show. Perhaps special effects will be more prominent. You can never tell. ④ That is why it’s nearly impossible to predict what adaptations will be necessary for the circus to survive, but if it is loyal to its roots, survive it will. Ultimately, the circus is an evergreen experience. It is living entertainment performed by ordinary people who are capable of extraordinary feats.

No, his greatest enemy is something much more mundane: namely, a simple lack of respect. Even within his own stories, he’s too long had to put up with being mistaken for a bird or a plane. 5.1. _ This, to be blunt, is just wrong. Let us be clear: Superman is the ultimate superhero, and it’s time everyone recognized that fact. \r\n\r\nIt’s not that Superman was the first superhero, as such. You can trace his lineage back through earlier pulp characters, for instance Zorro, who used his dual identity to battle corruption and crime. There’s also Doc Savage and Gladiator, heroes with abilities beyond those of normal men. 5.2. _ However, he can never be fully integrated into the society he protects, being the outsider that he is. This is because, on a daily basis, he has to deal with the fact that he is the final survivor of his entire race and his entire social circle consists of people who only know him through work and pile their own overwhelming expectations on him. \r\n\r\nAs if that wasn’t enough, Superman has proven to be an almost endlessly flexible character, and one who’s proven himself to be easily recreated to serve different purposes for different audiences throughout his existence. 5.3. _ Subsequent years found him functioning as the patriarchal head of a metaphorical Superfamily and a transformative avatar of identity fluidity in the 1950s and ’60s, and a successful Super-Yuppie in the 1980s. Throughout those various portrayals, though, the core of Superman stayed true: that he was, at heart, an almost impossibly good man, a hero that never gives up, and always does the right thing. 5.4. _ But such thinking has nothing to do with the very notion of superheroes: these aren’t realistic characters; they’re idealized characters, ones created as purposeful and eager rejections of realism in favor of worlds filled with evil geniuses and impossible monsters.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>abridged from http://entertainment.time.com</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 157, "fields": {"category": 15, "type": "reading", "layout": "reading-table", "title": "FURNITURE GALLERY IN VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM (V&A)", "text": "Read the text.

One paragraph does not match any of the questions. \r\n\r\nFURNITURE GALLERY IN VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM (V&A)\r\n\r\nA. In V&A’s furniture gallery there is a delicate and prettily painted corner cupboard from the workshop of the great 18th-century cabinet-maker, Thomas Chippendale. Its provenance is well recorded. We know it was made between 1768 and 1778; its curvaceous front and slim legs owing something to the emerging taste for the Classical style, and its painted decoration a nod to a new, exotic taste for the Orient. We also know that it was supplied as part of a bedroom suite to the celebrated actor David Garrick for his villa on the Thames, a detail that allows us a peek into the most intimate life of one of theatre’s brightest stars. \r\n\r\nB. Furniture is full of stories like this, a rich source of narratives that tell us about changing fashions, materials and production methods, as well as how people from different social groups lived. And the V&A has more than 14,000 such items in storage, which must have made selecting 200 pieces for its first dedicated furniture gallery extremely difficult. Those that made the final cut are arranged in a handsomely restored run of rooms, complete with shining parquet floor and a black-and-white colour scheme which, like the entire V&A these days, is so sparklingly lit and beautifully decorated it almost takes your breath away. \r\n\r\nC. Many of the objects selected to illustrate 600 years of design history are just as wonderful. Down the centre of the galleries a catwalk show of around 25 remarkable pieces tells the story of European furniture. Among the highlights are a German chest from 1520 and a table owned by Napoleon. In side niches, seven designers are honoured with dedicated displays. The most interesting of these is devoted to Michael Thonet, manufacturer of perhaps the most successful piece of furniture ever: the No. 14 bentwood café chair which went into production in Austria in 1859. By 1930, more than 50 million had been sold. \r\n\r\nD. The bad news is what the curators have done with the remaining 150 or so gems of the collection. These are grouped around the gallery’s sides and classified not according to date or style but by the techniques used. The problem with this approach is that it reduces these works, many loaded with the same kind of history as Garrick’s Chippendale cupboard, to the sum of their parts. We are unable to see how styles changed and  progressed, or how movements such as European Modernism blossomed. It doesn’t help either that the curators have done away with labels, experimenting with interactive touch-screens for which you have to queue if somebody else is using them – why not have both?\r\n\r\nE. All of this reminds me of the time when the Tate decided to hang its collections by genre, which resulted in the much-derided scenario of a Monet landscape next to a Richard Long installation. The Tate quickly backtracked. No doubt the V&A will eventually do the same, but in the meantime don’t be put off; the contents of this new gallery are five star, and it’s the contents that matter the most.\r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>abridged from www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment</i></p>", "sound_file": "", "image": ""}}, {"model": "exams.exams_task", "pk": 158, "fields": {"category": 15, "type": "grammar", "layout": "fill-gap-letter", "title": "A SUCCESSOR TO DAVID ATTENBOROUGH?", "text": "Read the text.
